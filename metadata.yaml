description: "La Conquête de Plassans (1874) is the fourth novel in Émile Zola's twenty-volume\
  \ series Les Rougon-Macquart. In many ways a sequel to the first novel in the cycle,\
  \ La Fortune des Rougon (1871), this novel is again centred on the fictional Provençal\
  \ town of Plassans and its plot revolves around a sinister cleric's attempt at political\
  \ intrigue with disastrous consequences for some of the townsfolk.\nAt the start\
  \ of the novel, the home life of Francois Mouret and his wife and cousin Marthe\
  \ (née Rougon) is portrayed as a generally pleasant and relaxed existence. Francois\
  \ is slightly compulsive in his behaviour and Marthe clearly suffers from some sort\
  \ of mental illness, which Zola intended to portray as a genetic consequence of\
  \ the Rougon-Macquart family's tangled ancestry. Their three children include the\
  \ eldest son Octave, an intelligent but feckless ladies' man (featured as the principal\
  \ character of two later novels in the cycle, Pot-Bouille (1882) and Au Bonheur\
  \ des Dames (1883), but here little more than a footnote), as well as the quiet\
  \ and introverted younger son Serge and the mentally-handicapped daughter Desirée.\
  \ Their home lives are shattered by the arrival of a strange cleric, Abbé Faujas,\
  \ and his mother, who rent a room in the Mourets' house. Slowly, it transpires that\
  \ the mysterious stranger has arrived to try and win influence in the town for outside\
  \ political forces (which never manifest themselves) through a series of Machiavellian\
  \ intrigues, plots, slanders and insinuations; in the process of doing so, he proceeds\
  \ to unravel the Mourets' lives to such an extent that the bewildered Francois is\
  \ unwillingly and unnecessarily committed to a mental institution, while poor Marthe\
  \ becomes obsessively religious, though whether her devotion is to God or Faujas\
  \ becomes increasingly unclear. In Mouret's absence, and Marthe's indifference,\
  \ Faujas unscrupulous sister Olympe and brother in law Trouche take over the Mouret's\
  \ house, and live high at their expense. The reaction of the townsfolk to Faujas'\
  \ outside influence is fascinatingly drawn by Zola, and the tactics of the groups\
  \ who are in \"resistance\" to Abbé Faujas' clever machinations are very keenly\
  \ observed. The narrative is kept up at a tremendous pace and builds to a quite\
  \ astonishing climax of violence and horror as Zola ends the novel in a near-apocalyptic\
  \ fury.\nAlthough the novel does assume in its readers a degree of familiarity with\
  \ the battle between clerical political interests and governmental influence in\
  \ the provincial towns of the Second Empire - knowledge which Zola's contemporary\
  \ readers would certainly have taken for granted, but which seems obscure and almost\
  \ arcane now - its strength lies not in its politics but in its human drama. On\
  \ the face of it this could have been a relatively dull series of political observations,\
  \ but instead by the end it is almost a melodrama, such is the anticlerical fury\
  \ which Zola instils in his work.\nThe English translation done by Ernest Vizetelly\
  \ in the 1880s, still in print under the title The Conquest of Plassans, is much\
  \ more readable than many of the other Vizetelly texts. A more modern retranslation\
  \ was undertaken by Brian Rhys for Elek Books and published in 1957 under the more\
  \ expressive but less faithful title A Priest in the House, but it is no longer\
  \ widely available.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
